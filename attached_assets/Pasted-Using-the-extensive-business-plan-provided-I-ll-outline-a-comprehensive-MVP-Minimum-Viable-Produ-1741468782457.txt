## Comprehensive MVP Plan for Your Website

### 1. **Brief Description of Business/Product**
Trinity Trading and Consulting Limited is introducing a **commodity purchase and shipping algorithm** that serves as a **"compare-the-market" solution** for businesses importing commodities into the UK.

Two key products will be developed:
1. **Compare-the-Market Web Portal**: A user-friendly website for B2B customers.
2. **API for Integration**: A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) API enabling integration into third-party systems.
